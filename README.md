Odin-recipies is the first project to complete on The Odin Project, using basic HTML skills to create a website. 4 iterations of the website will be made, starting from setting up the index to making 3 full recipe pages with images, different headings, emphasis and bolding, and more and having them link back to the homepage. Completing this project will test my basic HTML skills, git skills, and how well I can apply the information I studyed in this course so far
